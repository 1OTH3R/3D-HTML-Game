I had help from GPT to make a fun little 3D web game. In this web game, you can jump, fall over, spin, and do lots of parkour as a funny little rectangular prism. There's only some shading and fun colors, so it shouldn't be too resource-intensive.

To play it, just get the HTML file from the button above that says `Code` and run it from there, or just make your own `.html` file and copy and paste it.
This was a quick and fun project that was made by me ([1OTH3R](https://github.com/1OTH3R)) and is my second project ever posted on GitHub.


Have fun!
